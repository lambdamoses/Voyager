Getis-Ord Gi\* is used to find hotspots and coldspots of a feature in space. A hotspot is a cluster of high values in space, and a coldspot is a cluster of low values in space. Getis-Ord Gi\* is essentially the z-score of the spatially lagged value of the feature at each location $i$ ($\sum_j w_{ij}x_j $), where $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight. In the [original publication for Getis-Ord Gi\* from 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x) [@Getis1992-fh], the spatial weight is a distance-based binary weight indicating whether another location is within a certain distance from each location $i$. Getis-Ord Gi excludes the location $i$ itself in the computation of mean and variance of the lagged value, while Gi\* includes the location $i$ itself. Usually Gi and Gi\* yield similar results. The mean and variance used in the z-score differ in Gi and Gi\* and is described in [this paper from 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x) [@Ord1995-bv] and derived in [@Getis1992-fh]. Binary weights in the spatial neighborhood graph are recommended for Getis-Ord Gi\*.
