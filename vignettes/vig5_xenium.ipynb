P-values and types of neighborhoods are also computed. \"Type of neighborhood\" include cells with low values and neighbors with low values (low-low), low-high, high-high, and high-low, and \"low\" and \"high\" are relative to the mean. One can make a scatter plot with the value at each cell on the x axis and spatially weighted average of the cell's neighbors on the spatial neighborhood graph on the y axis; this is the Moran scatter plot. These neighborhood types are quadrants on the plot. However, when the value doesn't deviate much from the mean, the neighborhood type might not mean much, but it does seem to highlight some tissue structure. Another caveat is that the mean is from the entire section, while from tissue morphology, there clearly are two very different regions within the section.

    "By default, for gene expression, the log normalized counts are used in spatial autocorrelation metrics because many statistical methods were developed for normally distributed data and there can be technical artifacts affecting the raw gene counts per cell, so before running Moran's I, we normalize the data. In the single cell tradition, total counts (nCounts) is treated like a technical artifact to be normalized away, which makes sense given the transcript capture and PCR amplification steps in the single cell RNA-seq protocol. However, as seen above, nCounts clearly has biologically relevant spatial structure, and imaging based technologies don't have those steps. Furthermore, in imaging based technologies, typically a curated gene panel of a few hundred genes targeting certain cell types of interest is used, while scRNA-seq is usually untargeted and transcriptome wide. Due to the skewed gene panel, nCounts is biologically skewed as well so using it to normalize data can lead to false negatives in finding spatially variable genes and differential expression [@Atta2024-tl]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes cell area is used when normalizing imaging based data, which makes sense when larger cells have more room for more transcripts and as seen above in the matrix plot, cell area does positively correlate with nCounts. However, as seen in the earlier cell level QC plots, cell size is also spatially structured and seemingly biologically relevant because cells of some types tend to be larger than cells of some other types, though its global Moran's I is a bit weaker than that of nCounts. Often some cells are larger because more of them get captured in this section and some cells are smaller because less of them are in this section, so there still is a technical component. In [@Atta2024-tl], normalizing by cell area and not normalizing are also examined; here SVG and DE results are more comparable to when using a more representative gene panel, with fewer false positives and false negatives compared to normalizing by nCounts. Due to the technical effect of partial capture of cells in the section, [@Atta2024-tl] recommends normalizing with cell area if it's reliable. While cell area from XOA v1 with cell segmentations that look like Voroni tessellation doesn't seem reliable, with multiple fluorescent stains in XOA v2, it seems much better, so we'll normalize with cell area here while noting the caveat that cell area can be biologically relevant."
