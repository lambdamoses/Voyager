\usage{
plotImage(
  sfe,
  sample_id = "all",
  image_id = NULL,
  channel = NULL,
  ncol = NULL,
  bbox = NULL,
  maxcell = 5e+05,
  show_axes = FALSE,
  dark = FALSE,
  palette = colorRampPalette(c("black", "white"))(255),
  normalize_channels = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfe}{A \code{SpatialFeatureExperiment} object.}

\item{sample_id}{Sample(s) in the SFE object whose cells/spots to use. Can be
"all" to compute metric for all samples; the metric is computed separately
for each sample.}

\item{image_id}{ID of the image(s) to plot. If \code{NULL}, then the first
image present is plotted. Can be a vector of IDs to use different grayscale
images for different channels. The vector can be named ('r', 'g', 'b'), to
assign channels to images. The vector must be named if it's length 2.}

\item{channel}{Numeric vector indicating which channels in a multi-channel
image to plot. If \code{NULL}, grayscale is plotted if there is 1 channel
and RGB for the first 3 channels. The numeric vector can be named (r, g, b)
to indicate which channel maps to which color. The RGB colorization may not
be colorblind friendly. This argument cannot be specified while
\code{image_id} is a named vector to plot different grayscale images as
different channels.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns if plotting multiple features. Defaults to
\code{NULL}, which means using the same logic as \code{facet_wrap}, which
is used by \code{patchwork}'s \code{\link{wrap_plots}} by default.}

\item{bbox}{A bounding box to specify a smaller region to plot, useful when
the dataset is large. Can be a named numeric vector with names "xmin",
"xmax", "ymin", and "ymax", in any order. If plotting multiple samples, it
should be a matrix with sample IDs as column names and "xmin", "ymin",
"xmax", and "ymax" as row names. If multiple samples are plotted but
\code{bbox} is a vector rather than a matrix, then the same bounding box
will be used for all samples. You may see points at the edge of the
geometries if the intersection between the bounding box and a geometry
happens to be a point there. If \code{NULL}, then the entire tissue is
plotted.}

\item{maxcell}{Maximum number of pixels to plot in the image. If the image is
larger, it will be resampled so it have less than this number of pixels to
save memory and for faster plotting. We recommend reducing this number when
plotting multiple facets.}

\item{show_axes}{Logical, whether to show axes.}

\item{dark}{Logical, whether to use dark theme. When using dark theme, the
palette will have lighter color represent higher values as if glowing in
the dark. This is intended for plotting gene expression on top of
fluorescent images.}

\item{palette}{Vector of colors to use to color grayscale images.}

\item{normalize_channels}{Logical, whether to normalize each channel of the
image individually. Should be \code{FALSE} for bright field color images
such as H&E but should set to \code{TRUE} for fluorescent images.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
This function plots the images in SFE objects without plotting geometries.
When showing axes, the numbers are coordinates within the image itself and
have the same units as the spatial extent, but are not the actual spatial
extent when plotting multiple samples to avoid excessive empty space.
